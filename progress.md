# Progress Log

Running log of code changes in this repo — every change, not just infra
(infra/architecture incidents also get an entry in [RUNBOOK.md §16](RUNBOOK.md),
which stays the source of truth for those; this file is the source of truth
for everything else, including cleanups and small fixes that RUNBOOK.md
doesn't cover).

**Read this before starting new work**, the same way `RUNBOOK.md` gets read
before diagnosing production issues. This file exists because it didn't
before — a duplicate `requirements.phase1.txt` missed the SQLAlchemy driver
fix, then nearly missed the openai/google-api-python-client cap too, because
nothing recorded that the first fix had ever happened or where it had been
applied. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) "Maintain `progress.md`".

Newest first.

## 2026-09-28 — Repo maintenance session

**Removed 17 dead files (PR #2, merged to fork `master`).**
Audited every `.py`/`.txt` script in the repo against CI workflows,
`render.yaml`, code imports, docs, and directives. Files with zero references
anywhere were deleted; files referenced only in docs/directives were left
alone pending human confirmation.

Removed:
- `requirements.phase1.txt` (root duplicate — the real one is
  `client_inbox_foundation_phase1/requirements.phase1.txt`)
- `execution/process_inbox_smart.py`, `process_and_organize.py`,
  `explore_email_folders.py`, `fetch_sample_interviews.py`,
  `setup_sharepoint.py`, `log_to_sharepoint.py`
- `services/dashboard/check_db.py`, `import_interviews.py`,
  `import_interviews_from_summary.py`, `backfill_runs.py`,
  `extract_interview_details.py`, `fetch_real_email_content.py`
- `services/dashboard/api/check_db.py`, `check_auth.py`,
  `requirements.py313.txt`, `requirements.py313.fixed.txt` (abandoned Python
  3.13 experiment; `render.yaml` builds from `requirements.txt` only)

Verified via `pytest --co -q` (345 tests collected, no import errors from any
deletion) and full run (327 passed, 18 pre-existing failures in
`test_log_interview.py` — unrelated `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
'models'`, confirmed identical on `master` before this change via
`git stash` comparison).

**Deferred, not done:** `RUNBOOK.md` §14 already flags a separate batch of
Railway-era stale files (`services/dashboard/api/railway.json`,
`services/dashboard/README.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`, `FULLSTACK_QUICKSTART.md`,
stale comments in `database.py`) as known-stale but out of scope for this
session.

**`CLAUDE.md` updated** to require a `progress.md` entry with every code
change going forward (this file, created this session).

## 2026-09-28 — Dependency version caps (in progress, not yet merged)

Branch `chore/cap-major-version-pins`, pushed to fork, reviewed and approved
by Ali via email. **PR not yet opened** — pending explicit go-ahead.

Scope: cap `openai` at `>=1.0.0,<2.0.0` and `google-api-python-client` at
`>=2.100.0,<3.0.0` (or `>=2.161.0,<3.0.0` for the phase1 variant) across 5
files: `requirements.txt`, `execution/requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`,
`requirements.phase1.txt` (root — since removed, see above),
`client_inbox_foundation_phase1/requirements.phase1.txt`. The `openai` cap
was verified against actual usage — `execution/classify_email.py` targets the
1.x client API (`openai.OpenAI(...)`, `RateLimitError`, `APIStatusError`).
Left untouched per Ali's scope call: pytest, black, flake8, mypy, fastapi,
twilio, httpx, tenacity.

Note: this branch was cut before the `chore/remove-dead-scripts` cleanup, so
it still contains the now-deleted root `requirements.phase1.txt` — will need
a rebase or conflict resolution against current `master` before merge.

## Earlier history (inferred from `RUNBOOK.md` §16 and git log — predates this file)

- **2026-09-25** — Dashboard silently stopped recording emails while GH
  Actions stayed green. Root cause: unpinned `sqlalchemy>=2.0.0` picked up
  2.1.0's driver default change (psycopg v3, not installed) →
  `execution/db_url.py` added to pin `postgresql+psycopg2://`; DB write
  failures now alert. Backfill via `execution/backfill_missed_runs.py`
  recovered 262 of ~327 missed emails. PR #1
  (`fix/sqlalchemy-21-psycopg-driver`).
- **2026-09-18** — Local Docker cron container's `tail -f` PID1 problem fixed
  (`exec cron -f` instead); dashboard "Next run in" countdown desync fixed.
- **2026-09-08** — Move/delete pipeline switched from IMAP sequence numbers
  to UIDs + Gmail label ops; fixed a 300+ email backlog bug.
- **2026-08-31** — `emails.message_id` UNIQUE constraint added for dedup;
  `keepalive.yml` added; `DATABASE_URL` secret corrected Railway → Neon.
- **2026-06-27** — Two-pass Spam Review system added.
- **2026-06-03** — Backend + DB migrated Railway → Render + Neon.
- **pre-2026-06** — Railway backend + Windows Task Scheduler era. Deprecated.

For full detail on any of the above, see `RUNBOOK.md` §16 and `git log`.
